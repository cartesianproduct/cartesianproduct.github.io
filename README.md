# Cartesian Product 

Work that we compiled during the Energy Challenge Hackathon

# Prompt: 

Access to timely and reliable data about renewable development is a major barrier to the expansion of energy access

Implications of Data Constraints:

Lack of data and the ability to quickly analyze it developers from answering critical questions, such as:

• Who Needs It the Most?

– Household data to help identify those most in need Household 

• Who Can Pay? 

 – A lack of access to reliable data prevents developers and investors to accurately assess viability

• Where Should We Build? 

Qualitative, quantitative and geospatial data for helping determine renewable energy is currently incomplete

# Solution:

Our Motto is:

- See the data
- Be the data 
- Add to the data

# Workflow:

This is a adaptable solution for any data beyond Myanmar(Burma).  But this is the overall process:

After the data is uploaded, you can look it at a Township level.  This can easily be changed to zip codes.

Or in a heatmap by selecting data you want to display:

You can also check the Microgrid data and the distances to a power line, the closer it is to a power line the bigger the circle

You can also look at energy potential.  Shaded areas have higher potential as opposed to the lighter areas.
