# Cartesian Product 

Information and data that we compiled during the Energy Challenge Hackathon

# Prompt: 

Access to timely and reliable data about renewable development is a major barrier to the expansion of energy access

Implications of Data Constraints:

Lack of data and the ability to quickly analyze it developers from answering critical questions, such as:

• Who Needs It the Most?

– Household data to help identify those most in need Household 

• Who Can Pay? 

 – A lack of access to reliable data prevents developers and investors to accurately assess viability

• Where Should We Build? 

Qualitative, quantitative and geospatial data for helping determine renewable energy is currently incomplete
